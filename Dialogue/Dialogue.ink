Ah, young wanderer, what brings you to this sacred realm? 
Krit, filled with a mixture of awe and trepidation, approaches the sage cautiously.
    *[I seek answers, wise one. Answers to questions that weigh heavy on my heart.]

-Questions of purpose, of destiny, of the very essence of existence, yes?
"Then ask, young one. Ask and you shall receive the wisdom you seek."
    +[Why am I here? What is my purpose in this vast universe? And what role do I play in the grand tapestry of life?]

-The sage's eyes gleam with ancient knowledge as he listens intently to Krit's inquiries.

Ah, the age-old questions that have echoed through the ages. The answers you seek lie not in the words of others, but in the depths of your own soul.

Krit's heart races with anticipation, his curiosity piqued by the sage's cryptic words.

    +[But how do I find these answers? How do I unlock the secrets hidden within?]

-Patience, young one. Patience and introspection are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of the universe. Look within, and you shall find the truth you seek.

    +[Thank you. I will heed your words and embark on this quest with courage and determination.]

-With newfound resolve, Krit sets forth on his journey, his heart brimming with curiosity and a thirst for enlightenment.

(The scene fades to black, leaving behind an aura of mystery and anticipation as Krit ventures into the unknown.)
